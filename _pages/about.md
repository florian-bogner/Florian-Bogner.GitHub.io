This is my first website ever. I'm about to start a Data Scientist course, and in order to prepare for it, I did some training over at Codecademy. From there, GitHub piqued my interest, I googled for templates and found this beautiful yet clean [academicpages template] from (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). However, I did a mistake when forking and cloning to my computer and subsequently pushing it to GitHub. I'll fix that later :-).
